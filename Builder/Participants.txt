 The classes and objects participating in this pattern are:

Builder  (VehicleBuilder)
	specifies an abstract interface for creating parts of a Product object

ConcreteBuilder  (MotorCycleBuilder, CarBuilder, ScooterBuilder)
	constructs and assembles parts of the product by implementing the Builder interface
	defines and keeps track of the representation it creates
	provides an interface for retrieving the product

Director  (Shop)
	constructs an object using the Builder interface

Product  (Vehicle)
	represents the complex object under construction. ConcreteBuilder builds the product's internal representation and defines the process by which it's assembled
	includes classes that define the constituent parts, including interfaces for assembling the parts into the final result
