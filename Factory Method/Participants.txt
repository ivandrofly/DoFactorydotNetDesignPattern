The classes and objects participating in this pattern are:

Product  (Page)
	defines the interface of objects the factory method creates

ConcreteProduct  (SkillsPage, EducationPage, ExperiencePage)
	implements the Product interface

Creator  (Document)
	declares the factory method, which returns an object of type Product. Creator may also define a default implementation of the factory method that returns a default ConcreteProduct object.
	may call the factory method to create a Product object.

ConcreteCreator  (Report, Resume)
	overrides the factory method to return an instance of a ConcreteProduct.
