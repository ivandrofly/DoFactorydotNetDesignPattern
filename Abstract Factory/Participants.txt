The classes and objects participating in this pattern are:

AbstractFactory  (ContinentFactory)
	declares an interface for operations that create abstract products

ConcreteFactory   (AfricaFactory, AmericaFactory)
	implements the operations to create concrete product objects

AbstractProduct   (Herbivore, Carnivore)
	declares an interface for a type of product object

Product  (Wildebeest, Lion, Bison, Wolf)
	defines a product object to be created by the corresponding concrete factory
	implements the AbstractProduct interface

Client  (AnimalWorld)
	uses interfaces declared by AbstractFactory and AbstractProduct classes
